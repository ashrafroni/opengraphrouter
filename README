Summary

OpenGraphRouter is a system for building road networks into a network
graph file. The network graph file can then be used to solve various
graph analysis on the network and to generate driving instruction.

A project to create of open source routing engine for navigation and
possibly other graph analysis. Our goal is to build a commercial grade
routing engine capable of find routes through 25-30 million node
networks in 1 second ball park times.

This project is starting out as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.
This GSoC project is the work of Mohammad Ashraf Hossain and is being
mentored by Stephen Woodbridge. For more information see:
